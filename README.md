### ðŸ¤– Telegram bot with a few different strange features. ðŸ¤¨ðŸ™ƒ
_I created this bot for testing some Telegram features like parsing, logging, calculating distance etc._

**You can test it on Telegram - [@zaka11bot](https://t.me/zaka11bot "test ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦").**

---

To use all features of this code, you need to replace all `550557267` IDs to your telegram ID. You can change the location (coordinates) to yours as well.\
You must have __config.py__ file in the same path as __bot.py__ with this text: `token = "PUT_YOUR_TELEGRAM_TOKEN_HERE"`
