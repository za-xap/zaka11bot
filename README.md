# zaka11bot
ðŸ¤– Telegram bot with a few different strange features. ðŸ¤¨ðŸ™ƒ
I created this bot for testing some Telegram features like parsing, logging, calculating distance etc.
You can test it on Telegram - @zaka11bot.

To use all features of this code, you need to replace all 550557267 IDs to your telegram ID. You can change the location (coordinates) to yours as well.
You must have config.py file in the same path as bot.py with this text: 'token = "PUT_YOUR_TELEGRAM_TOKEN_HERE"' (without ')
